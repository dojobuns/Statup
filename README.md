# Statup

##Overview

Statup is a collective informational HUB for players to use to see their stats from the game League of Legends. It is a collection of all your stats from previous games that you have played, all put together in a very easy to understand, clean design for viewing.  Its goal is to give players a hub that has all of their game statistics in one place.  Also to check the player's averages compared to the average of players in their region.  To show where you are in your stats comparatively to the region you are in.  Whether you are below or above average, to quickly be able to know whether you're in the green or you need to improve to catch up.  These are all qualities that my app, statup, will have.  This is also just for development to showcase my programming ability.
